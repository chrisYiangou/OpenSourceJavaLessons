# OpenSourceJavaLessonns

# A Little intro 

My name is Christopher Yiangou and I am a Software Development trainer.

These are some personal notes that I use for teaching Java and thought it would be good for students to have open acessibility to my learning material, so here you go!!!! 

No fees attached - if you ever need me to explain java or another programming language just let me know and I can always lend a hand.
