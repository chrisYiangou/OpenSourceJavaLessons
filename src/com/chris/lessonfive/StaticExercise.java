	/* Have you ever heard of the Math Class, its a great Class with methods that we can 
	 * use to create random numbers.
	 * 
	 * Try and construct this Class like we have done in previous examples
	 * Explain why the result you have found has occurred?
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Create a variable and method within a class that acts as a counter --- so overtime the function is used it 
	 * adds one to a global static variable.
	 * 
	 * Use Final variables to store some constants
