	//This exercise is all about you
	//I want you to create your own class('s) and it can be anything that you want!
	//Breakout room + Peer Programming is highly encouraged.
	
	//I want you to have at least 5 different variables, all preferably a different
	//data type.
	//Additionally I want you to create three different methods (Not Including the 
	// Constructor)!
	//Think outside the box for these methods and over achieve - go beyond the lessons
	// if you so dare. I want to be impressed.
	
	//I will give you 20 mins to complete this - After this I would like people to demonstrate 
	// what they were able to create
